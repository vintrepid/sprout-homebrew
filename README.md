## Cookbook Usage

### Attributes


*NOTE:* All preferences are namespaced under `sprout => homebrew` they include:

* `formulae` &mdash; The list of brew packages to install
  - To install the formula at the HEAD revision (rather than stable), use a hash with the following keys:
    - `name` &mdash; The name of the package
    - `head` &mdash; Set to `true`
* `casks` &mdash; The list of casks to install
* `launchctl` &mdash; The list of packages to automatically start (managed by
   launchctl). Each package is a key value e.g. `tor: load` where the value is
   one of:
   - `load` &mdash; Start the package at system start, and launch immediately
   - `unload` &mdash; Do not start the package at system start, and stop if currently running
   - `reload` &mdash; Reload a package already set to start at system start
